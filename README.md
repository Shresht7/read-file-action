<h1 align='center'>Read File Action</h1>

---

<!-- slot: description  -->
A GitHub Action read, parse and expose contents of a file
<!-- /slot -->

## ðŸ“– Usage

Use this action in a workflow step

```yaml
- name: read-file
  id: read-file
  uses: Shresht7/read-file-action@v1
  with:
    path: ./README.md
```

You can then access the output contents using [expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions).

`${{ steps.read-file.outputs.contents }}`

> Note: this assumes you set the id as `read-file`.

The action will, by default, try to automatically parse `yaml` or `json` files and export the contents as a stringified JSON. This output can be used by `fromJSON` in an [expression](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions) or `JSON.parse` in an action.

You can also explicitly state the type of the file by passing it in as a input

```yaml
- name: read-file
  id: read-file
  uses: Shresht7/read-file-action@v1
  with:
    path: ./package.json
    type: json
```

If you need to retrieve the raw string, set the `type` to something like `raw` or `null`.

## ðŸ“ƒ Workflow Example

The following workflow snippet demonstrates how this action can be used to read a file and  its contents can be used by other actions. The snippet itself is placed here using this action in conjunction with the [markdown-slots](https://www.github.com/Shresht7/markdown-slots) action.
